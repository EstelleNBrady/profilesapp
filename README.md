# Serverless Web Application: "Power of 10" Architecture

## Overview
This project demonstrates a serverless web application built using the **"Power of 10"** architecture. The application showcases modern AWS services and their integration to deliver a scalable, secure, and fully functional solution.  

Key highlights of this project:  
- **Frontend:** Hosted on **AWS Amplify**  
- **Backend Logic:** Implemented using **AWS Lambda**  
- **Database:** Managed via **Amazon DynamoDB** (NoSQL)  
- **API Management:** **Amazon API Gateway**  
- **Security:** Configured with **IAM policies**  

The project provided hands-on experience in the **Developer domain** of AWS certification, focusing on:  
- Integrating **AWS services** for end-to-end functionality  
- Creating and deploying **RESTful APIs**  
- Handling **CORS** configurations  

## Architecture
[Frontend: AWS Amplify] <--> [API Gateway] <--> [AWS Lambda] <--> [DynamoDB]


- **Frontend:** React-based UI hosted on Amplify for serverless deployment  
- **Backend:** Lambda functions handle application logic  
- **Database:** DynamoDB stores and retrieves application data  
- **API Gateway:** Serves as the RESTful API interface  
- **Security:** IAM roles ensure secure access between services  

## Features
- Fully serverless architecture  
- **RESTful API** communication  
- Scalable **NoSQL database**  
- Secure integration via **IAM policies**  
- Hands-on implementation of **CORS handling**  

## Skills Demonstrated
- **AWS Amplify** deployment and hosting  
- **Lambda** function development
